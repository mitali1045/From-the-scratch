# From-the-scratch
Python code solution to problem statements

Larrys array : Larry has been given a permutation of a sequence of natural numbers incrementing from 1 as an array. He must determine whether the array can be sorted using the following operation any number of times:
Choose any  consecutive indices and rotate their elements in such a way that ABC -> BCA -> CAB -> ABC
This solution includes logic build from the scratch, and could also be replaced with the concept of "Inversion".

Larrys array -- inversion : Includes the concept of Inversion & optimisation of the code.

Ranking : An arcade game player wants to climb to the top of the leaderboard and track their ranking. The game uses Dense Ranking, so its leaderboard works like this:
The player with the highest score is ranked number  on the leaderboard.
Players who have equal scores receive the same ranking number, and the next player(s) receive the immediately following ranking number.
